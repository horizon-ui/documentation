description: Introduction about Horizon UI

Get started and build your dream web app with Horizon UI Dashboard, the most
trendiest & innovative Admin Dashboard for Chakra UI, React and Figma!

---

## Introduction

Horizon UI Dashbord is built with over 400+ frontend individual elements, like
buttons, inputs, navbars, nav tabs, cards, or alerts, giving you the freedom of
choosing and combining. All components can take variations in color, which you
can easily modify using JSS files and classes.

You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code
because all elements are implemented.

This Premium Dashboard is coming with prebuilt design blocks, so the development
process is seamless, switching from our pages to the real website is very easy
to be done.

## Intro

Install Horizon UI Dashboard by running either of the following:

- Install NodeJS LTS from
  [NodeJs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en/?ref=creativetim) (NOTE: Product
  only works with LTS version)

Clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simmmple-web/horizon-ui-dashboard.git
```

Run in terminal this command:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run this command to start your local server

```bash
npm start
```

## Add custom theme (Optional)

Inside Horizon UI Dashboard, you can find the `ChakraProvider` component inside
`/src/layouts/Admin.js` and `/src/layouts/Auth.js`.

If you need to customize the default chakra theme to match your design
requirements, you can extend the `theme` from `@chakra-ui/react`.

Chakra UI provides an `extendTheme` function that deep merges the default theme
with your customizations.

```jsx live=false
// 1. Import the extendTheme function
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react"

// 2. Extend the theme to include custom colors, fonts, etc
const colors = {
  brand: {
    900: "#1a365d",
    800: "#153e75",
    700: "#2a69ac",
  },
}

const theme = extendTheme({ colors })

// 3. Pass the `theme` prop to the `ChakraProvider`
function App({ Component }) {
  return (
    <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>
      <Component />
    </ChakraProvider>
  )
}
```
